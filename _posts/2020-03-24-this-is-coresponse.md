# CORESPONSE

## Objective

The development of a simplified ventilation device that is built with the help of a 3D printer and a few components so that it can be easily reproduced and assembled by volunteers all over the world. This device aims to save lives during the COVID19 crisis.

## Who we are?

We are an interdisciplinary team consisting of engineers and clinicians from RWTH Aachen University.

## The idea

The device is meant to provide a last resort for the possible situation when COVID19 infections outnumber the capacities of medical ventilation at healthcare facilities.

The device automatically squeezes widely available bag valve masks (BVMs, “Ambu-bags”).

The device is not developed as a medical device. It is not meant and not safe to be used without strict supervision. It is intended to be used when the situation is at a point where the only remaining alternative would be using volunteers to operate BVMs manually.


## The advantages

-Main components: 3D-printable parts, bag valve mask, motor
-All necessary files and building instructions will be made open source. 
-Anyone with access to a standard FDM 3D printer can build the device independently within one day. A large number of devices can be manufactured within a short period of time.
