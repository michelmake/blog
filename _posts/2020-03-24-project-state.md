#State of the Project

Two different concepts are currently pursued in parallel. Both concepts should allow an adjustable breathing volume (tidal volume) and a variable respiratory rate. Additional oxygen can be administered via the BVM.

**Concept 1** uses a DC geared motor at a constant speed. This concept requires very simple electronics and no special control (“switch on and go”). The bag is operated using a 3D printed mechanism. The breathing volume is adapted by adjusting the mechanism.

First prototype of Concept 1. Rapid development iterations are happening currently with improvements to the design.


**Concept 2** uses a servo or stepper motor. This concept requires slightly more complex electronics for the control of the motor, but only a very few mechanical parts. The function can be adjusted using a smartphone.

The first prototypes have already been implemented and are currently evaluated and improved with a test lung (AEROtube®).
At the same time, a homepage is set up with replication instructions and all necessary files for printing the parts.

##COSTS AND MATERIAL

-Current status of building costs: below 75 Euro (Concept 1).
-Production: decentralized by volunteers owning an FDM 3D-Printer with a build plate of 20cmx20cm (250g Filament)
-Bag valve mask
-Electric motor and power supply
-Few mechanical small parts (e.g. screws)
