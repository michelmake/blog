            "content": "CORESPONSE . Objective . The development of a simplified ventilation device that is built with the help of a 3D printer and a few components so that it can be easily reproduced and assembled by volunteers all over the world. This device aims to save lives during the COVID19 crisis. . Who we are? . We are an interdisciplinary team consisting of engineers and clinicians from RWTH Aachen University. . The idea . The device is meant to provide a last resort for the possible situation when COVID19 infections outnumber the capacities of medical ventilation at healthcare facilities. . The device automatically squeezes widely available bag valve masks (BVMs, “Ambu-bags”). . The device is not developed as a medical device. It is not meant and not safe to be used without strict supervision. It is intended to be used when the situation is at a point where the only remaining alternative would be using volunteers to operate BVMs manually. . The advantages . -Main components: 3D-printable parts, bag valve mask, motor -All necessary files and building instructions will be made open source. -Anyone with access to a standard FDM 3D printer can build the device independently within one day. A large number of devices can be manufactured within a short period of time. . . State of the Project . Two different concepts are currently pursued in parallel. Both concepts should allow an adjustable breathing volume (tidal volume) and a variable respiratory rate. Additional oxygen can be administered via the BVM. . Concept 1 uses a DC geared motor at a constant speed. This concept requires very simple electronics and no special control (“switch on and go”). The bag is operated using a 3D printed mechanism. The breathing volume is adapted by adjusting the mechanism. . . Concept 2 uses a servo or stepper motor. This concept requires slightly more complex electronics for the control of the motor, but only a very few mechanical parts. The function can be adjusted using a smartphone. . The first prototypes have already been implemented and are currently evaluated and improved with a test lung (AEROtube®). At the same time, a homepage is set up with replication instructions and all necessary files for printing the parts. . COSTS AND MATERIAL . Current status of building costs: below 75 Euro (Concept 1). | Production: decentralized by volunteers owning an FDM 3D-Printer with a build plate of 20cmx20cm (250g Filament) | Bag valve mask | Electric motor and power supply | Few mechanical small parts (e.g. screws) | .",
