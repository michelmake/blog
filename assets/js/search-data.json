            "content": "CORESPONSE . Objective . The development of a simplified ventilation device that is built with the help of a 3D printer and a few components so that it can be easily reproduced and assembled by volunteers all over the world. This device aims to save lives during the COVID19 crisis. . Who we are? . We are an interdisciplinary team consisting of engineers and clinicians from RWTH Aachen University. . The idea . The device is meant to provide a last resort for the possible situation when COVID19 infections outnumber the capacities of medical ventilation at healthcare facilities. . The device automatically squeezes widely available bag valve masks (BVMs, “Ambu-bags”). . The device is not developed as a medical device. It is not meant and not safe to be used without strict supervision. It is intended to be used when the situation is at a point where the only remaining alternative would be using volunteers to operate BVMs manually. . The advantages . -Main components: 3D-printable parts, bag valve mask, motor -All necessary files and building instructions will be made open source. -Anyone with access to a standard FDM 3D printer can build the device independently within one day. A large number of devices can be manufactured within a short period of time. . . State of the Project . Two different concepts are currently pursued in parallel. Both concepts should allow an adjustable breathing volume (tidal volume) and a variable respiratory rate. Additional oxygen can be administered via the BVM. . Concept 1 uses a DC geared motor at a constant speed. This concept requires very simple electronics and no special control (“switch on and go”). The bag is operated using a 3D printed mechanism. The breathing volume is adapted by adjusting the mechanism. . . Concept 2 uses a servo or stepper motor. This concept requires slightly more complex electronics for the control of the motor, but only a very few mechanical parts. The function can be adjusted using a smartphone. . The first prototypes have already been implemented and are currently evaluated and improved with a test lung (AEROtube®). At the same time, a homepage is set up with replication instructions and all necessary files for printing the parts. . COSTS AND MATERIAL . Current status of building costs: below 75 Euro (Concept 1). | Production: decentralized by volunteers owning an FDM 3D-Printer with a build plate of 20cmx20cm (250g Filament) | Bag valve mask | Electric motor and power supply | Few mechanical small parts (e.g. screws) | .",

            "title": "Concept Cable Winch v0",
            "content": "Concept Cable Winch . Description . The concept aims to realize a compression of a bag-valve-mask with as little moving parts as possible. This reduces the number of parts which have to be printed and weak points. A simple pulley is used to pull two printed parts together and compress the bag. . However, this concept requires a motor which can be position controlled (e.g. a servo or a stepper motor). Consequently, a micro controller is required to pass the inputs to the motor. On the plus side, the software allows a higher customizability of the air flow, volume and frequency. . Required Components . . 3D printed parts from Thingiverse: . enclosure | pulley | pusher | . Electrics: . Dynamixel servo motor (XL430-W250-T or better, we had an XM430-W350-T lying around) | OpenCM9.04 board | 12V DC power supply | . Norm pieces: . 4x: M2.5x16 cylinder head screws | 4x: M2.5 washer | 4x: M2x9 countersunk screws | . Others: . Elastic | Lace | . Tools: . allen wrench size 2 | small slot screwdriver | . Build Instructions . First, mount the motor on the enclosure using the M2.5x16 screws and washers. . Next, pass the lace through the hole in the pulley and knot it tightly. Pass the lace through the rectangular hole in the enclosing and mount the pulley on the motor’s flange using the M2 countersunk screws. . Pass the elastics through the smaller holes of the enclosure and through the outer holes of the pusher. The lace has to be passed through the center holes of the pusher. If you would like a secure fit, pass the elastic and lace through the handle of the bag. You could also place both over the handle for easier unmounting of the whole device. . Finally, knot the elastic and the lace to the other side of the enclosure. . Programming the board . The code and instructions to flash the OpenCM9.04 board are available in this github repository. . Lessons learned . The bag can be compressed by the small servo motor but the bags are quite sticky. Thus, the lace cannot move freely around the bag and the enclosure moves instead of the pusher. Also, the motion is more like folding the bag and not pushing it in the middle. On the plus side, the bag can be held at the handle and performs almost no motion. This is beneficial for the patients well being. . The next iterations will continue to emphasize using the handle to place the bag over the patient. An improvement should be expected by applying the force evenly in the middle of both sides to suppress the motion of the enclosure. .",
