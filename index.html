This site is for all information about the project [CORESPONSE](https://coresponse.github.io/blog/).

The objective is the development of a simplified ventilation device that is built with the help of a 3D printer and a few components so that it can be easily reproduced and assembled by volunteers all over the world. This device aims to save lives during the COVID19 crisis.
