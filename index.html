#Objective
The objective is the development of a simplified ventilation device that is built with the help of a 3D printer and a few components so that it can be easily reproduced and assembled by volunteers all over the world.
#Design Strategy
Strict application of the [KISS principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle). The devices operate standard [bag valve masks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag_valve_mask). Overall design goal is to minimize complexity as well as the need for additional non-printable parts, specifically considering electronics.
